# tree-sitter-setup

> Tree-sitter is a fast, modern parser generator tool built for incremental parsing and syntax highlighting. It generates based on selected language and provides insight into the code and transforms it into a clear and structured map called Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This AST is a tree structure that represents the code syntax and relationship between entities.
